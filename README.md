# Particle-Swarm-Optimization-for-ANN
In this project, I implement PSO algorithm to train ANN instead of Gradient Descent.


Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is a population-based approach to search for solutions in the solution space. Its related to evolutionary computations where a swarm of particles use their collective effort to reach a level of intelligence that allows the swarm to reach a local solution. PSO is used for optimising nonlinear functions as a replacement to the widely known approach Gradient Descent.
